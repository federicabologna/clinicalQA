Genital herpes can manifest with fluid-filled blisters on or around the genitals that burst and develop into sores that typically resolve within 1-2 weeks. During the first infection, Swollen lymph nodes and flu-like symptoms may also be experienced.. Outbreaks of genital lesions can reoccur, as the virus never leaves the body after initial infection.\nMost infected individuals are asymptomatic or only experience mild symptoms. HSV is spread through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and contact with the skin, saliva, or sores of a person who has the infection. Oral antiviral therapy can be used to treat patients with recurrent genital lesions to reduce the severity of symptoms and lower the risk of transmission to an uninfected sexual partner.\n\nA HPV infection is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). There are many different strains of HPV. Low-risk strains can cause warts on the skin or genitals, whereas high-risk strains of HPV are associated with an increased risk of several types of cancer, such as cervical, throat, mouth, anus and genital cancer. HPV is spread by vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and close skin-to-skin contact with someone who has the infection.
