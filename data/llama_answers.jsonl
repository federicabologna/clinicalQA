While it's not a typical presentation for most shoulder conditions, there are a few possible explanations. \n\n1. Referred pain: Sometimes, pain from a lung condition, such as pneumonia, pleurisy, or pulmonary embolism, can radiate to the shoulder. This type of pain is usually sharp and worsens with deep breathing or coughing.\n\n2. Diaphragmatic irritation: The diaphragm, a dome-shaped muscle that separates the chest and abdominal cavities, can become irritated due to various factors, such as inflammation, infection, or injury. This irritation can cause pain that refers to the shoulder and worsens with breathing.\n\n3.

{"question_id": "question_101", "question": "Is it normal for tendinitis to only affect just extension, and not both extension/flexion?", "answer_id": "llama_6", "answer": "Yes, it is normal for tendinitis to only affect a specific movement or action, such as extension, and not both extension and flexion. Tendinitis is inflammation of a tendon, which is a fibrous cord that connects muscles to bones. When a tendon becomes inflamed, it can cause pain and stiffness, especially when the affected muscle or joint is used in a specific way.\n\nIn the case of tendinitis affecting only extension, it's likely that the tendon involved is one that is primarily responsible for facilitating extension movements. For example, in the elbow, the extensor tendons (such as the extensor carpi radialis brevis) are responsible for wrist extension, and tendinitis in these tendons can cause pain and stiffness when extending the wrist, but not when flexing it.\n\nThis is because the tendon is subjected to different stresses and strains depending on the direction of movement. In extension, the tendon may be subjected to more tensile stress, leading to inflammation and pain, whereas in flexion, the tendon may be subjected to less stress, resulting in less or no pain.\n\nIt's worth noting that tendinitis can affect multiple movements or actions, but it's not uncommon for it to be more pronounced or isolated to a specific movement or action. A proper diagnosis and evaluation by a healthcare professional, such as an orthopedic specialist or a primary care physician, can help determine the underlying cause and extent of the tendinitis.", "answer_type": "llama"}

{"question_id": "question_184", "question": "Whats the difference between Valtrex and Acyclovir?", "answer_id": "llama_34", "answer": "Valacyclovir (Valtrex) and acyclovir (Zovirax) are both antiviral medications used to treat viral infections caused by herpes viruses, including herpes simplex (HSV) and herpes zoster (VZV). The primary difference between them is their bioavailability, which refers to the proportion of a drug that enters the bloodstream when it is introduced into the body and so becomes effective.\n\nValacyclovir is a prodrug of acyclovir, meaning that it is converted into acyclovir in the body. This conversion increases its bioavailability, making it more easily absorbed by the body than acyclovir. As a result, valacyclovir is typically taken less frequently than acyclovir - usually two to three times a day compared to acyclovir's five times a day - which can improve patient compliance.\n\nBoth medications work by inhibiting viral DNA synthesis and replication, thus reducing the severity and duration of herpes outbreaks. They can also be used to suppress the virus, reducing the frequency of outbreaks.\n\nIn terms of efficacy, both drugs are effective against herpes viruses, but the improved bioavailability of valacyclovir may make it slightly more effective in some cases. However, the choice between valacyclovir and acyclovir often comes down to individual patient needs and preferences, including factors such as dosing frequency and cost.", "answer_type": "llama"}

Before using Tinactin, read and follow the label instructions carefully. Make sure to clean and dry the affected area thoroughly before applying the medication. Apply the medication as directed, usually 2-3 times a day, and for the recommended duration, even if symptoms improve before finishing the treatment course.\n\nHowever, if your symptoms worsen, don't improve with treatment, or you experience any signs of a more severe infection (such as increased redness, swelling, or pus), seek medical attention. Additionally, if you have a weakened immune system or are taking medications that might interact with antifungals, consult your doctor before starting any new treatment.", "answer_type": "llama"}

{"question_id": "question_103", "question": "Is it ok to take the antibiotic along with my thyroid meds?", "answer_id": "llama_99", "answer": "Generally, it is safe to take antibiotics with thyroid medications. However, the type of antibiotic and thyroid medication being taken should be considered. Certain antibiotics, such as rifampicin, can affect the levels of thyroid hormones in the blood by increasing the metabolism of levothyroxine (a common thyroid medication). This might require an adjustment of the thyroid medication dose. \n\n     To ensure safe and effective treatment, it is essential to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are currently taking, including your thyroid medications and any antibiotics prescribed. They can provide personalized guidance and monitor any potential interactions.", "answer_type": "llama"}
