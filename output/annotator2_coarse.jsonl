Common symptoms include a painful sore in the mouth, tingling or burning before the ulcer appears, and a white or yellow oval with an inflamed red border.\n\nOral herpes, caused by the herpes simplex virus (usually HSV-1), presents as painful blisters or sores on or around the lips, inside the mouth, or on the gums and face. Unlike canker sores, these blisters are filled with fluid and may burst and crust over. Oral herpes is contagious and can be transmitted through oral contact. Symptoms can be preceded by itching, burning, or tingling around the lips or face.\n\nTo summarize, canker sores are usually a single non-contagious ulcer within the mouth with a white or yellow center and a red border, localized to the inside of the mouth. In contrast, herpes sores tend to be grouped blisters that are external on the lips or around the oral region and are contagious.\n\nIf uncertainty persists or if the lesion does not heal or worsens, consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.", "answer_type": "gpt4", "annotation_type": "coarse", "rated": "No"}
{"question_id": "question_96", "question": "Is accutane like an antibiotic and would it affect a baby if I got pregnant?", "answer_id": "gpt4_36", "answer": "Accutane (isotretinoin) is not an antibiotic; it is a retinoid, derived from Vitamin A, and is used primarily to treat severe acne. Unlike antibiotics, which target bacteria, isotretinoin works by reducing the amount of oil released by oil glands in your skin and helping your skin renew itself more quickly.\n\nIsotretinoin is highly teratogenic, meaning it can cause significant birth defects if taken during pregnancy. This includes severe malformations of the fetus and developmental delays. For this reason, it is crucial to avoid pregnancy while taking isotretinoin and for one month after stopping the medication. Women of childbearing age are typically required to use two forms of birth control and undergo monthly pregnancy tests before, during, and after the course of treatment. If you are considering pregnancy or become pregnant while taking isotretinoin, you should stop taking the medication immediately and consult your doctor. Additionally, isotretinoin can also pass into breast milk and harm a nursing baby.

When the virus reactivates from its latent phase, it can travel down the nerve to the skin, causing lesions to appear along the path of the nerve, which can sometimes result in sores appearing on the chin or other facial areas.", "answer_type": "llama", "annotation_type": "coarse", "rated": "No"}
{"question_id": "question_21", "question": "Can Clindamyam be used to treat a UTI", "answer_id": "llama_70", "answer": "Clindamycin is an antibiotic that is effective against a variety of bacterial infections. However, it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for urinary tract infections (UTIs). This is because most UTIs are caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli, which are often resistant to clindamycin. Clindamycin is more effective against gram-positive bacteria and anaerobic bacteria.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other medical organizations recommend other antibiotics, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim), nitrofurantoin (Macrobid), or fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin), as first-line treatments for uncomplicated UTIs.\n\nHowever, in certain cases, such as complicated UTIs or UTIs caused by specific types of bacteria that are susceptible to clindamycin, this antibiotic may be prescribed. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment, as they can determine the most effective antibiotic for a specific UTI based on the type of bacteria causing the infection and other factors.", "answer_type": "llama", "annotation_type": "coarse", "rated": "No"}

This damage can impair the production of digestive enzymes, including lipase, resulting in low levels.\n\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects the pancreas and other organs, causing thick, sticky mucus to build up and block the release of digestive enzymes. This blockage can lead to low levels of lipase and other enzymes.\n\nPancreatic cancer, on the other hand, may not directly cause low lipase levels. In fact, pancreatic cancer can sometimes lead to elevated lipase levels, especially if the tumor is blocking the pancreatic duct and causing an accumulation of enzymes.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that low lipase levels can have various causes, and a thorough medical evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause.

Genital herpes can manifest with fluid-filled blisters on or around the genitals that burst and develop into sores that typically resolve within 1-2 weeks. During the first infection, Swollen lymph nodes and flu-like symptoms may also be experienced.. Outbreaks of genital lesions can reoccur, as the virus never leaves the body after initial infection.\nMost infected individuals are asymptomatic or only experience mild symptoms. HSV is spread through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and contact with the skin, saliva, or sores of a person who has the infection. Oral antiviral therapy can be used to treat patients with recurrent genital lesions to reduce the severity of symptoms and lower the risk of transmission to an uninfected sexual partner.\n\nA HPV infection is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). There are many different strains of HPV. Low-risk strains can cause warts on the skin or genitals, whereas high-risk strains of HPV are associated with an increased risk of several types of cancer, such as cervical, throat, mouth, anus and genital cancer. HPV is spread by vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and close skin-to-skin contact with someone who has the infection.
