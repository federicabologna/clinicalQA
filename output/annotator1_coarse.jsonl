Common symptoms include a painful sore in the mouth, tingling or burning before the ulcer appears, and a white or yellow oval with an inflamed red border.\n\nOral herpes, caused by the herpes simplex virus (usually HSV-1), presents as painful blisters or sores on or around the lips, inside the mouth, or on the gums and face. Unlike canker sores, these blisters are filled with fluid and may burst and crust over. Oral herpes is contagious and can be transmitted through oral contact. Symptoms can be preceded by itching, burning, or tingling around the lips or face.\n\nTo summarize, canker sores are usually a single non-contagious ulcer within the mouth with a white or yellow center and a red border, localized to the inside of the mouth. In contrast, herpes sores tend to be grouped blisters that are external on the lips or around the oral region and are contagious.\n\nIf uncertainty persists or if the lesion does not heal or worsens, consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.", "answer_type": "gpt4", "annotation_type": "coarse", "rated": "No"}
{"question_id": "question_96", "question": "Is accutane like an antibiotic and would it affect a baby if I got pregnant?", "answer_id": "gpt4_36", "answer": "Accutane (isotretinoin) is not an antibiotic; it is a retinoid, derived from Vitamin A, and is used primarily to treat severe acne. Unlike antibiotics, which target bacteria, isotretinoin works by reducing the amount of oil released by oil glands in your skin and helping your skin renew itself more quickly.\n\nIsotretinoin is highly teratogenic, meaning it can cause significant birth defects if taken during pregnancy. This includes severe malformations of the fetus and developmental delays. For this reason, it is crucial to avoid pregnancy while taking isotretinoin and for one month after stopping the medication. Women of childbearing age are typically required to use two forms of birth control and undergo monthly pregnancy tests before, during, and after the course of treatment. If you are considering pregnancy or become pregnant while taking isotretinoin, you should stop taking the medication immediately and consult your doctor. Additionally, isotretinoin can also pass into breast milk and harm a nursing baby.

{"question_id": "question_11", "question": "Are lutein and omega 3 good for vision ?", "answer_id": "physician_30", "answer": "Lutein is a carotenoid compound which is available in green leafy vegetables (kale, broccoli, spinach, lettuce, and peas), along with other foods, such as eggs, pistachios, and corn. Lutein is found in high concentration in the retina, which is the light sensitive area of the eye. Studies have attributed anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and blue light-filtering effects to lutein. The studies suggest that lutein may protect against and reduce the severity of many eye diseases. By reducing damage to the retina, lutein may enhance vision in both normal and diseased eyes.\nDocosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid found naturally in fish, is also found in the retina. DHA is involved in the process of transforming light to a neurological signal and generating light sensitive pigment. Studies on the effects of DHA (omega 3) found mixed results on improvement of vision, but no studies showed a negative effect.
