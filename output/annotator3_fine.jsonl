This type of pain is usually sharp and worsens with deep breathing or coughing.\n\n 2.

This irritation can cause pain that refers to the shoulder and worsens with breathing.\n\n 3. Thoracic outlet syndrome: This condition occurs when the nerves or blood vessels between the neck and shoulder are compressed, leading to pain and discomfort in the shoulder, arm, or chest. Deep breathing can exacerbate the compression, causing increased pain.\n\n 4.

They are usually round or oval with a yellow or white base surrounded by a red border. Canker sores are typically solitary and not contagious. The exact cause is unknown, but they are thought to result from a combination of factors, including minor mouth injury from dental work, hard brushing, sports mishaps, or accidental cheek bite, as well as certain foods, stress, and some systemic diseases.\n\n On the other hand, herpes, specifically oral herpes, is an infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). It causes small, fluid-filled blisters or sores on the lips, mouth, or around the oral area. These sores are often painful, can be multiple, and tend to recur. Oral herpes is contagious and can be spread through direct contact with an infected person's lesions or through viral shedding from skin even when no lesions are visible.\n\n To differentiate between canker sores and herpes, look for the following:\n\n- Location: Canker sores are found inside the mouth, while herpes sores are typically found on the lips, around the mouth, or on the gums.\n - Appearance: Canker sores are usually solitary, round, and have a yellow or white base", "answer_type": "llama", "annotation_type": "fine", "rated": "No", "sentence_id": "llama_35_0"}
