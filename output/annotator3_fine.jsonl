{"question_id": "question_181", "question": "Whats a cluster headache?", "answer_id": "llama_63", "answer": ":orange[Cluster headaches are a type of headache disorder known for their extreme pain and pattern of occurring in cyclical periods or clusters.] They are one of the most painful types of headaches. Cluster headache attacks often wake up patients from sleep and are accompanied by symptoms such as tearing and redness of the eye, nasal congestion, or sweating. These symptoms typically occur on the same side of the head as the headache.\n\n Cluster headaches are relatively rare and affect about 1 in 1,000 people. Men are more commonly affected than women, with a male-to-female ratio ranging from 2.5 to 3.5:1. The exact cause of cluster headaches is unknown, but it is believed to involve abnormalities in the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that regulates body temperature, hunger, and thirst.\n\n Treatment for cluster headaches usually involves a combination of acute treatments to manage individual headache attacks and preventive treatments to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks during a cluster period.

The onset of type 1 diabetes can be rapid, often occurring over a few weeks, and is typically seen in children and young adults.\n\n In contrast, type 2 diabetes tends to develop more gradually, often over months or years. However, some people with type 2 diabetes may experience a rapid onset of symptoms, particularly if they have a significant underlying insulin resistance or if they are taking certain medications that can raise blood sugar levels.\n\n Another form of diabetes, known as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), can also have a rapid onset.

Molecularly speaking, Valacyclovir is a prodrug of acyclovir, which is converted into acyclovir in the body. Among other differences is that Valacyclovir is only available as oral tablets, whereas acyclovir is available as oral tablets, oral capsules, sublingual tablets, oral suspensions, creams, and injectable solutions. In addition, Valacyclovir has a longer duration of action and greater bioavailability compared to acyclovir.
