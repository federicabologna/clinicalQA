Tendinitis is inflammation of a tendon, which is a fibrous cord that connects muscles to bones. When a tendon becomes inflamed, it can cause pain and stiffness, especially when the affected muscle or joint is used in a specific way.\n\nIn the case of tendinitis affecting only extension, it's likely that the tendon involved is one that is primarily responsible for facilitating extension movements. For example, in the elbow, the extensor tendons (such as the extensor carpi radialis brevis) are responsible for wrist extension, and tendinitis in these tendons can cause pain and stiffness when extending the wrist, but not when flexing it.\n\nThis is because the tendon is subjected to different stresses and strains depending on the direction of movement. In extension, the tendon may be subjected to more tensile stress, leading to inflammation and pain, whereas in flexion, the tendon may be subjected to less stress, resulting in less or no pain.\n\nIt's worth noting that tendinitis can affect multiple movements or actions, but it's not uncommon for it to be more pronounced or isolated to a specific movement or action.

The primary difference between them is their bioavailability, which refers to the proportion of a drug that enters the bloodstream when it is introduced into the body and so becomes effective.\n\nValacyclovir is a prodrug of acyclovir, meaning that it is converted into acyclovir in the body. This conversion increases its bioavailability, making it more easily absorbed by the body than acyclovir. As a result, valacyclovir is typically taken less frequently than acyclovir - usually two to three times a day compared to acyclovir's five times a day - which can improve patient compliance.\n\nBoth medications work by inhibiting viral DNA synthesis and replication, thus reducing the severity and duration of herpes outbreaks. They can also be used to suppress the virus, reducing the frequency of outbreaks.\n\nIn terms of efficacy, both drugs are effective against herpes viruses, but the improved bioavailability of valacyclovir may make it slightly more effective in some cases.
